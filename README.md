# WEATHER BLOCK

## Overview

This project is a fully rebuilt weather dashboard focused on **same-day, near-live weather updates**.

It supports:

- Place search (city/location name)
- Device geolocation (optional)
- Near-real environmental metrics at selected coordinates
- 7-day daily summary and recent hourly history
- Interactive location map

## Data Source

Primary weather data is fetched from:

- Open-Meteo Forecast API: https://open-meteo.com/

Key datasets used:

- Current conditions: temperature, apparent temperature, humidity, pressure, wind, dew point, precipitation
- Hourly timeline: same-day/recent hourly weather metrics
- Daily summary: max/min temperature, precipitation sum, humidity mean, wind max

Location lookup is done with OpenStreetMap Nominatim:

- Forward geocoding: place name -> latitude/longitude
- Reverse geocoding: coordinates -> place label

## Accuracy Notes

- Live feeds are updated frequently, but exact refresh cadence depends on the upstream weather provider.
- Data can still differ from hyper-local station sensors due to model/grid resolution.

## Features

- Live/same-day weather metrics (temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, precipitation, dew point)
- Computed "feels like" estimate for warm/humid conditions
- Latest valid hourly observation in UTC
- Latest 24 hourly records table
- 7-day daily summary cards
- Hyper-prism UI style (glass layers, gradient atmosphere, neon accents)
- Skeleton loading states for metric fields, table rows, and map panel
- Responsive desktop/mobile layout
- Satellite map preview with place label overlay and marker

## Project Structure

```
weatherApp/
|-- index.html
|-- style.css
|-- script.js
|-- README.md
```

## Run Locally

No build step is required.

1. Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or
2. Use a lightweight local server (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

1. Enter a city/place in the search field and click **Search**.
2. Or click **Use My Location** and grant location permission.
3. Read current metrics, daily summary, and hourly history.
4. Use the map panel to confirm the exact coordinates being queried.
